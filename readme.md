# Travel Site Project

This is the main project of Brad Schiff's "Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow" on Udemy. I didn't vary much from the code provided by Brad, though I did code it all myself (i.e., I did not download any pre-existing finished code). This is the first Udemy course I completed in its entirety.

Grateful to Brad for putting together a great course! Taught me Git, Github, npm, Gulp, PostCSS, and building/deploying a website start to finish. Loved it.
